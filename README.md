# Flashlight

A simple top-down video game that I made in C# with Unity. 

Play the finished game here: https://pixelmationgames.itch.io/lonely-light

Everything in the game is made by me except the font, (8-Bit Operator), sound effects (from the Kenney Asset Pack), and enemy pathfinding algorithm (https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
